I'm all for delineating the various points of view on why one name is used by one group of people, and the article does a good job of that. But as you point out the most widely used name is FGM, and if a 4.5 or 3 to 1 ratio is not a significant  majority than I don't know what it is. Secondly, the pov issue is very much with the people here and not with the literature. Lets be clear about the rationale of the UN bodies which have opted to use the term FGC. According to their own websites (and this page), they use the term FGC in communities where the term FGM may be seen as counterproductive to the goal of reducing the occurrence of FGM. They do not use it in their published literature and their websites make it clear that it is an application of the term for case-specific scenarios and not as an overall attempt to cease the use of the term FGM.   19:48\",\n",

Whether we're looking at these things as rings or lattices or fragments of formal logic or whatever is the wrong question. The right question is: who is the audience? And the answer is: there is more than one of them. At least as the current US college system is set up, many beginning computer science students need an article like Boolean algebra (logic) or Boolean logic, and would be baffled and lost by the mathematical formalism in Boolean algebra (structure). On the other hand, mathematicians from the advanced undergraduate level upwards would find those articles simplistic and useless, and need instead something like Boolean algebra (structure) or Boolean algebras canonically defined. We don't have to hide the fact that they're all really the same thing, but I think trying to make the freshman computer scientists learn ring theory in order to look up de Morgan's laws, or trying to make the math majors wade through lots of truth tables, would be a bad idea in either case.  And I think that trying to please both audiences in a single article would lead to a mess that's even worse than the current mess in Boolean logic. So, please do consider some merges — we have too many articles — but please don't take your one unified theory and insist that it's the only way the subject can be presented. —\",\n",

The more of that lost information that we can reconstruct, the more reliable our scientific hypotheses are likely to be.  ….  From the original complete assemblage of living organism, known as a ‘life assemblage” or biocenosis, many events occur that screen out certain organisms, leaving a much smaller death assemblage, or thanatocenosis.  The process of breakup and decay of organism immediately after death is known as necrolysis. \\n\\n“After a death assemblage accumulates, many other factors operate on the hard parts to break them up and scatter them around, so an even smaller percentage ends up buried for future fossilization.  These processes occur after necrolysis and are known as biostratinomy.  These agents of destruction can be biological, mechanical, or chemical.\\n\\n“Biological agents are the most important factor in most environments, both marine and terrestrial.  Both predators and scavengers are very active in breaking up shells and bones ….  In summary, the key factor that prevents biological destruction is rapid burial.”\\n\\nFor those organism that are not buried right away:\\n\\n“Mechanical agents of destruction such as wind, waves, and currents can be very important.  These processes are most effective in shallow waters, where both waves and storm have their highest energies.  … In summary, the shape, density, and thickness of the bone or shell are the most important factors in determining survival under mechanical transport [until burial].”\\n\\n“After burial a variety of digenetic [chemical] changes in the rock can easily destroy shells.  … In summary, the original composition and the groundwater chemistry are the most important factors in determining whether digenetic changes are likely to alter or dissolve a fossil.”\\n\\n“Taphonomic research has come a long way since the pioneering studies of the 1960s and 1970s.  Paleontologists can no longer afford to naively take the fossil record at face value, but must always keep in mind the taphonomic “noise” that may obscure the original biological ‘signal’.”\\n\\nLagerstatten:\\n\\n“The processes outlined above account for most fossilization and what we know of the living organism is usually quite incomplete.  However, there are extraordinary fossil deposits around the world that preserve soft tissues and sometimes even skin texture and color patterns. … These are known as Lagerstatten (German for “mother lode”), and they have produced some of the most important fossils known.  … From all these examples, several general trends emerge.  The best fossilization occurs when there is rapid burial and anoxic conditions to prevent scavenging, no reworking currents and little or no digenetic alteration to destroy the fossils.”\\n\\nThe Museum of the Rockies here in Bozeman is the realm of paleontologist Jack Horner.  I have often heard Jack speak, pointing out that the dinosaurs of Montana were almost all killed and buried by catastrophic river floods near the shore of the inland sea that is now Eastern Montana, the Dakotas and related Canadian States.  The bones and the geology both acclaim to that.  Of course, these floods are considered local in extant.  This same theme is echoed on many signs and posters through out the museum.',\n",

Is this not the same vandalism?\\n\\nHere is the statement on WP:SOAP\\nWikipedia is not a soapbox, a battleground, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. This applies to articles, categories, templates, talk page discussions, and user pages. Therefore, content hosted in Wikipedia is not:\\n\\nPropaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.[1] \\n\\nOpinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to \"\"climb soapboxes\"\" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete. However, Wikipedia\\'s sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles. \\n\\nScandal mongering or gossip. Articles about living people are required to meet an especially high standard, as they may otherwise be libellous or infringe the subjects\\' right to privacy. Articles should not be written purely to attack the reputation of another person. \\n\\nSelf-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest. \\nAdvertising. Articles about companies and products are written in an objective and unbiased style. Article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small \"\"garage\"\" or local companies are typically unacceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they identify major organizations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Wikipedia neither endorses organizations nor runs affiliate programs. See also Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) for guidelines on corporate notability. Those promoting causes or events, or issuing public service announcements, even if noncommercial, should use a forum other than Wikipedia to do so. \\n\\nClearly I have not tried to recruit, sell, gossip or self-promote.  The opinion peices are clearly talking about article and not discussion pages and are stated as such. The opinion I have stated are backed up with facts and hence on the discussion page.

I have never given money to the IRA, I am Irish Catholic and I support Sinn Fein, but not the IRA. I personally do not believe the IRA are terrorists in the same veign as the UDA/UVF, Hezbollah or Al Qaida. The IRA is much more like the Iraqi Kurds, Northern Alliance, Jewish Irgun, French Resistence, and American Revolutionaries. I am also not a UDA/UVF terrorist apologist as Jdorney seems to be.\\n\\nI also resent being banned just because some wanna-be administrator is upset that my article contains more accuracies then his does. I have re-edited my article and placed all the proper Sources, page numbers, and Quotes. I have also added to the \"\"Sources\"\" index. I have never ment to purposely delete anyones work, if I did so it was by accident and I apologize.

I have a rather extensive library, and often purchase books for the purpose of responsibly editing on this site.  It's a rather expensive exercise and requires more time than simply deleting sources I'm not familiar with.  There have been times that I did not like a source that was listed, and bought several other sources in order to rebuild or supplement information that was insufficiently verified.\\n\\nAgain, this is a slower and more expensive process than simple deletion.  I'd appreciate it if you do the same.  If you don't mind, could you let me know if you have deleted other sources I've provided on this site?

Hi Regarding deleting this article as being not notable. the company was founded in 1824 and was an important ant horn comb manufacturer before the advent of plastics  it exported combs from England to America and the company was then very well known an ordinary thing like a comb used to be expensive as it was made of horn. The company Stockley and Wakelin does not trade any more so there is no commercial pourpose. There is another delete tag that that the article violates copyright as the material is elsewhere on the net. There is no copyright violation as the text elsewhere on the internet is my own. I am selling a Comb from made by Stokely and Wakelin on e bay and decided to do a write-up on Stockely and wakely - The comb is being sold for six pounds - so my intention to write the article on the company could hardly be for the purpose of flogging the one ccomb. Rather a comb was and is an important article of everyday use. There are no articles on horn combs which were used before plastics on Wikipedia and I was only trying to fill a gap by writing a article and improving on horn combs about what we used before plastics. Any way the article can be undeleted so that I and other wikipedians may improve on it and contribute to the knowledge of horn combs.',\n",

We had a very difficult time months ago removing Mexico from Central America in the article North America. Why? Because an \"\"anonimous\"\" user (IP from Toronto Canada) was reverting all the changes. I finally discovered he was an already registered user and got him blocked because of sockpuppetry. One month later, I found out he was already been accused of sockpuppetry with that account.\\n\\nWell my point is that he is against of Mexico being included in North America. His main \"\"argument\"\" was that the UN geosheme includes Mexico in CA and that\\'s it. He also denies that North America is also a subregion of America and ignores the cited content proving him wrong. Well, he is Corticopia. For months he was retired and trust me, NO BODY changed the articles North America and Central America (specially this one) to say Mexico was in CA.\\n\\nSuddenly a \"\"new\"\" user shows up. He deleted a line in the article CA. It said \"\"Mexico is rarely, yet sometimes included in Central America under certain definitions\"\". This line was discussed and agreed. He changed it to \"\"Mexico is included in Central America\"\" then to \"\"Mexico is sometimes included in Central America\"\".\\n\\nI don\\'t know what his problem is. The important thing is I totally felt this is the same person we had a very serious vandalism problems months ago, so I checked his edit list. Wow! What a discovery, his first edit was the article Issac Asimov and articles about Canada and some other regions of the world. It was very obvious it was the same person. Please check this sources  and this . Please, read them carefully.\\n\\nPlease check the contributions of each accused sockpuppetry account, specially the one of User:Ex post factoid. It is very obvious he is the same person.\\n\\nHe was dragged into the article Mexico when he was unable to \"\"win\"\" again in the article Central America (he didn\\'t even try to change the article North America because he knows a lot of people guard that article). So his reason to say Mexico is in \"\"Southern North America\"\" are purely false and personal. He wants to \"\"exclude\"\" Mexico or make it \"\"look\"\" appart from Canda and the USA.\\n\\nI\\'m telling you this because I think you don\\'t realize his reasons are just personal, a personal aversion against Mexico being included in North America. If he\\'s so interested in accuracy of the articles, why isn\\'t he editing the article USA? He even asked Supaman to do it by himself. He\\'s just there to exclude Mexico. Please read carefully the evidence provided in each sockpuppetry case. You said that you\\'re an administrator in Spanish Wikipedia, so I think you\\'re experienced in these cases. You will find it is the same person. Cortiopia has edited the same pattern of articles that the other accounts did. Too bad I warned him and I\\'m sure he stopped editing with that account to prevent being identified. I think we should stop him and prevent him from editing the article with his biased, excluding information, even if sourced, because his reasons are just personal and not for the sake of accuracy.

       " '\"\\nChampionship does not mean \"\"first place.\"\" For example, in 2001 the St. Louis Cardinals and Houston Astros tied for 1st place in the NL Central Division. MLB did not recognize co-champions, allowing only Houston to raise a banner indicating that they won the Division Championship and print the same in their media guide. By contrast, in college athletics in the United States it is routine to recognize as co-champions any teams that finish tied for 1st without applying tiebreakers. This is because the recognition of a champion is in the hands of the organizing body. Here is a great example of the phenomenon I\\'m talking about: http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3033084. The story says that the \"\"Detroit Pistons clinched the Central Division and the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.\"\" Consistent usage here: http://www.democratherald.com/articles/2007/04/11/sports/national/6nat01_nbawest.txt. And here: http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2007-04-11-pistons-magic_N.htm?csp=34. And a variety of other sources. In short, I know that my usage is right (they have clinched their Conference\\'s No. 1 seed).

       " \"(UTC)\\nFor the sake of anyone reading this in the future, expected value is actually fairly easy to determine.  A (barely) simplified version of the formula for this discussion is: Number of Decisions * Average Bet * House Edge = Expected Value.  On a single number, single spin bet of $1 as the table suggests the EV according to that formula is 1 (decision) * 1 (bet) * 0.053 (edge, rounded) = $0.053.  For 10,000 spins at $1 the EV is $530 meaning the casino wins $530 as stated.  \\n\\nTo determine the player's edge for a straight up bet take the chances of winning (1/38) multiplied by the payout (35) plus the chances of losing (37/38) multiplied by the loss (-1).  (1/38 * 35) + (37/38 * -1) = -0.05263 or a loss of $0.05263 per dollar bet.  If you do the math this is the same edge for any double-zero wheel bet except for the top line.  As a random side note, to quickly determine the payout for any combination of numbers: 36/(numbers bet) - 1 = payout.  For example a street is three numbers so 36/3 - 1 = 11 therefore a street pays 11/1.    08:24, 17 February 2012\",\n",
       " '\"\\n\\n The \"\"Ethiopian birr model\"\" \\n\\nYou suggested to use this model in some cases. In my opinion, it is okay to include a territory in the current part succession box that has some autonomous rights (especially the right to have its own currency, like pre-2006 Montenegro or present-day Kosovo). Therefore, in the case of Ethiopian birr, it makes sense to speak about currency of Eritrea between 1952-1960 and between 1993-1997. between 1960-1993, only Ethiopian administration existed, Eritrea had neither sovereignty nor any sort of autonomous rights. (Saying in 1978 that the currency of Eritrea is the birr is like saying in 2006 that the currency of East Germany is the euro.) The same case of Austria between 1938-1945. Even Ukraine and Belarus represents the same situation during their Soviet Union \"\"membership\"\", however, both countries had more or less autonomy and were members of the UN since 1945. \\n\\nI have the fear that the innumerable border modifications in Europe during the XXth century will make huge and complicated succession boxes. For example, after WWII, Slovakia got back not only its Southern territories (Which the 1st Vienna Award awarded to Hungary in 1938), but three villages near to Pozsony / Bratislava (Horvátjárfalu / Jarovce, Oroszvár / Rusovce, Dunacsúny / Cunovo) were awarded to Slovakia (Treaty of Paris) due to strategic considerations. One could say that who cares with three villages, but this territory was part of Hungary between the two world wars - and it is not much smaller than Muraköz (Medimurje)...\\n\\nSo I don\\'t think each territorial change must be mentioned in the succession box. Only mention if the currency of a new country / state / autonomous province etc. (so a state-like subject that has the right to circulate its own currency) appears without precedessor (like Eritrean nakfa after split from Ethiopia in 1993, but unlike Ethiopian birr after split of Eritrea) or disappears without successor (like East German mark after the reunificaton of Germany in 1990, but unlike West-German mark after the reunification).\\n\\nFor example, German mark or deutschmark was the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany between 1948-2001. It would express that East Germany was simply integrated into West-Germany (contrary to the widely used \"\"reunification\"\" term), at least from the point of view of the circulating currency. It would also express that Germany is not the successor state of West Germany but the same country with an enlarged territory. \\n\\nIn the case of the pengő, I would simply say that it was the currency of Hungary between 1 Jan 1927 and 31 Jul 1946. Northern Transylvania, Southern Slovakia and Bácska was totally incorporated into the Hungarian administration. Subcarpathia enjoyed some autonomy, but it was very little and cannot be compared to the rights of then-Yugoslav federal states, present day US states or German federal states.\\n\\nNaturally, this is only my opinion, I would like to know your thoughts.  \"',\n",

The fact that Irenaeus stated that \"\"The thirty Æons are not typified by the fact that Christ was baptized in His thirtieth year: He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His baptism, but was more than fifty years old when He died.\"\" (Book II, Chapter 22) is one Joseph Wheless uses with nearly suppressed glee later on going as far as to say \"\"In the work often cited, Bishop Irenaeus either falsely quotes the Gospel of Mark, or the sacred text has been seriously altered in our present copies\"\" regarding some other point.  While Wheless\\' ax grinding does get on the nerves and there are some really flaky interpretations and misreadings he does raise some good points.  If as the Pro Historical Jesus camp state that Jesus was born c4 BCE and died c36 CE (a space of only 39 years) then how could Irenaeus expressly state Jesus lived at least 11 years longer than this span and that view was \"\"as the Gospel and all the elders testify\"\"?

I\\'ll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:\\n\\n Please don\\'t take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid \"\"academic phrasing\"\" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example \"\"social cost\"\" or \"\"social production\"\".\\n Speaking of \"\"social production\"\" it\\'d be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by \"\"proportions of social production\"\" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you\\'re equivocating between \"\"economic worth\"\" and \"\"social worth\"\" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I\\'m probably coming at this from a different background I\\'m wondering what exactly is the relationship between \"\"social product\"\" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.\\n \"\"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people.\"\" - I\\'m not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really \"\"inherently\"\" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn\\'t seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don\\'t think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern \"\"working class people\"\". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of \"\"economic worth\"\" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.\\n Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren\\'t really related. For example the question \"\"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?\"\" is not obviously or directly related to the question \"\"what was the social power of capital in 1840?\"\".\\n Some ideas for expansion: \"\"Theoretical problems\"\" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). \"\"Wage price series\"\" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I\\'m not sure what a \"\"real price\"\" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there\\'s also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There\\'s also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don\\'t really constitute a series but do provide \"\"snapshot\"\" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.\\n\\nI\\'d really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better.

I think it is a big mistake to announce that \"\"This article covers the non-theological aspects of free will\"\" as the root of the concept is at least partly theological. \\nImmediately recall that the very point of free will is to jusitify moral responsibility (historically, despite the fact that a perfect and omniscient god created man).\\nThen warn the reader that a perrenial source of confusion has been about the (apparent) randomness or non-determination in human choices and that this point will be adressed seperately because both \"\"aspects\"\" of free will are (apparently) at odds.\\nThen, maybe after some historical notes introduce compatibilits\\' (at least Hume-like) free will  the ability to choose in agreement to one\\'s principles (or main goals). The point of this definition is to found moral responsibility (ability to include the threat of punishment into one\\'s decision process).\\nOnce this definition has been given the rest of the issues are much clearer and especially the fact the some limited (macroscopic) determinism is required to give sense to it. 14:09, 3 October\"',\n",

During the first half of the year, the top players will play Super Rugby for the Bulls; during the second half, some of them will play for the Springboks. I suggest we list all players in this section that are contracted to the Blue Bulls, but also indicate if they play at national team level, at Super Rugby level, at Currie Cup level or at Vodacom Cup level only.\\n\\nWith the current format, I think the only way possible would be to have some kind of indicator.

Returning the chapter, or removing it?\\nThe chapter you removed is relevant, as I\\'d explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter.

The fact of the matter is that the first patrol to come across the wreckage was asked to investigate because the Joint Defense Operations Center on base detected the sound of the plane crashing into the ground. Bear in mind that the sound detector is used to listen for mortars and would hear a \"\"missile\"\" hitting the aircraft. Also, the reason the JDOC sent the first patrol to investigate was because the cameras that observe around the base were obstructed by the fog. This was the thickest fog I have ever seen. My section was the second section to be called up to respond to the crash. The first section to go out picked up the two barely surviving individuals and my section picked up the bodies with the pararescuemen. I was driving and I could barely see 75m ahead of my truck. There is absolutely no way that the enemy could spot the plane in the fog and shoot it down. Shooting down an aircraft is not an easy task for insurgents in the first place, shooting down a plane in that thick of fog, with a \"\"missile?\"\" (insurgents don\\'t have missiles), and having a \"\"missile\"\" that doesn\\'t make a sound is not possible and should not be given any credence. Also, the plane did not crash \"\"1.5 miles\"\" from the base. The hull of the plane and all the wreckage was about 200m from the fence, consistent with an attempted landing.

When I looked into it, I found that the subject of this article, John Brackenridge, seems to also lay claim to this title. Both were Presbyterian ministers, and both were alive and conceivably old enough to be chaplain during the period in question, but documented differences in their lives make it impossible that they are the same person. Brackenridge lived from 1772 to 1844, while Breckinridge lived from 1797 to 1841. Brackenridge was born in Pennsylvania, while Breckinridge was born at \"\"Cabell\\'s Dale\"\", his father\\'s plantation in Kentucky. Brackenridge married Eleanor White, while Breckinridge was twice married, first to a Miller, then to a Babcock. Further, reliable sources have Brackenridge as chaplain of the House and Senate at different periods in time, while Breckinridge is only mentioned as chaplain in the House. Does anyone know how to sort this out? I was thinking of creating an article on John Breckinridge (the younger), which presently doesn\\'t exist, but it would be nice to hammer this out first.

The whole essence of Dougweller\\'s argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.\\n\\nI went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi\\'s edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a \"\"diatribe\"\"; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi\\'s actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we\\'ve seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to \"\"justify\"\" my position, unlike what we\\'ve seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday\\'s edit was completely free from personal attacks; that\\'s undisputable.\\n\\nThe very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday\\'s tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as \"\"diatribe\"\", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.\\n\\nIf article talk pages aren\\'t meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop\\'s Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop\\'s Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday\\'s edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi\\'s conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )\"',\n",

Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object \\'in orbit\\'.\\n\\n That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn\\'t revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.\\n\\n Let me explain what I mean with my \"\"intuitiveness\"\" concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that\\'s not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that\\'s what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply \"\"antigravity\"\" to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he\\'s \"\"beating\"\" some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it\\'s real, he\\'s ready to accept that, although he\\'s applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to \"\"beat\"\" as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn\\'t really exist, that confuses the reader (\"\"then what\\'s the force that I\\'m beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn\\'t get it right...\"\") and s/he\\'s most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  \"',\n",

If you read Mesa Selimovic\\'s books you would know that the modern standardized Serbian language is older than both modern standardized Croatian and Serbocroatian as he wrote a book discussing Karadzic\\'s reforms. Also there are Croatian and Serbo-Croatian dialects that are not mutually understandable with the modern standardized Serbian that Selimovic wrote in, namely Cakavian and Kajkavian.\\nYou say Biographies are reliable sources. Then read this excerpt from Selimovic\\'s own autobiography \"\"Sjecanja\"\" that he wrote himself and you will find the following quotation: \"\"Potičem iz muslimanske porodice iz Bosne, a po nacionalnoj pripadnosti sam Srbin.

       " '\"=\"\"color:#4682b4\"\">Coldplay Expért]] Let\\'s talk \\nThis talk page is for discussing the article, not World War II history in general.   \\n\\n Summary of Consequences \\n\\nI believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events, and in a summary article, one must summarize the consequences. My edit, stating that \"\"as a result of the Franco-British action on Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed\"\" is a factual statement. This is not \"\"Stalin\\'s arguments\"\" this is not a \"\"Soviet Apologist stance\"\" this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event. In the Spanish Civil War the Red Army fought side by side with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Prior to the Franco-British assisted Nazi Sudetenland Grab, relations between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union were icy. When the Nazis were declaring war on Czechoslovakia, the USSR was hard at work putting together an anti-Nazi coalition. Only after seeing the British and French backed down in the face of naked anti-Slavic aggression, did the Soviets begin to look for other allies. There is no mass conspiracy here, as the search began right after the event. This is not a motive, it\\'s a statement of facts. If there are no more objections, I will reinsert the statement into the article, as it is merely cause and effect.   \\nRespectfully disagree. The statement \"\"as a result of the Franco-British action on Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed\"\" pretends to describe a casual linkage, although in actuality, the linkage was not so obvious, and the scholars\\' opinion on that vary dramatically. One school thinks that the only and sincere Soviet Union\\'s desire was to establish a collective security system and an anti-Hitler\\'s coalition. Another school believes that the only Stalin\\'s aim was the alliance with Hitler. The third version (the most reasonable, in my opinion) is that the USSR was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most European powers (that was, at least partially, justified), and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against Germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers (and, to expand its territory). The statement you tried to introduce into the article is a POV of the leftist part of the first group scholars. We cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events. We have either to tell a full story (that is impossible because of space limitations) or to abstain from any interpretations.Interestingly, your statement may be even simply incorrect, because, according to my sources, Hitler\\'s occupation of Czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the USSR, UK and France, and could lead to signing of Anti-Hitler triple alliance. In only a month after occupation of Czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks. Had Chamberlain and Stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other, and had Ribbentrop been little bit less active, WWII could be prevented.Re: \"\"This is not a motive, it\\'s a statement of facts.\"\" No. All these facts had already been in the article before your edits.

USSR secured a passage from Romania in order to assist Czechoslovakia. USSR placed all of its divisions west of the Urals on High Alert. After the seizure of Czechoslovakia, the USSR held the UK partially responsible, and frankly did not trust them, or the French, as allies.

While categories may require reliable sourcing, to a degree, the fact remains than for so many actors dating back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, especially, there is unlikely to be centralised sourcing, though many books are in print, such as actor biogs, few editors are really going to dig them all out and cite hundreds of actors entire career for each TV and film appearance, it would take months, even years, of effort. Wikipedia:Citing IMDb notes that IMDB has been a constant source of dispute over its reliability. However, for a category to simply state \"\"this person was a Western (genre) TV actor\"\" hardly requires AAA-rated reliable sourcing, and I do believe than IMDB meets the requirements as a tertiary source, confirming the fact that all those actors were active in that genre. Many of the individual articles for each Western TV series don\\'t contain any more sourcing than IMDB, so it is not wrong to identify MarnetteD\\'s reverts as \"\"missing the point\"\" when it comes to avoiding WP:POINTed behaviour. A tertiary source is better than no source at all, and categories are hardly top-level articles worth war-editing over. I find his behaviour protracted, bullyish and contrived as well as completely lacking WP:AGF standards. He needs to holster his attitude, because I\\'m not afraid to present his behaviour, including repeated history of the same behaviour, to ANI/EW and request that action be taken for his abuse of policy and anti-IP sniping motions. The lack of maturity exhibited in reverting those articles without consensus, openly taking advantage of my 48 hour block, will not be seen in good taste as it was clearly an opportunistic move, but a very stupid one which I don\\'t take lightly. WP:BURO and WP:IAR applies here. We don\\'t need strict reliable sourcing for a category as all those actors have an IMDB page, the majority of those IMDB pages are accurate, and if the category aims to improve wiki by indexing all the actors of that genre, it is for the better. To filter out those which lack a reliable source lacks NPOV because there are dozens of categories which make statements about things and people which don\\'t have strong sourcing. But in this case, knowing an actor was a Western TV actor is hardly controversial. If MarnetteD reverts a single page he should be prepared to back it up with something other than WP:DEFINING, which is a guideline, not policy, but so far as \"\"if the characteristic would not be appropriate to mention in the lead portion of an article, it is probably not defining\"\" goes, there are considerably more articles that don\\'t follow that ideal to the letter than do, which makes it a weak guideline to attempt to enforce unless an editor has a strong motive to do so.

       " '\"== Perceptions of cuteness ==\\n\\nI am ambivalent about the old meme reference in this section that the below poster complains about.  However, I do have a real criticism:\\n\\nThe line \"\"here are good evolutionary reasons to expect humans to find juvenile humans, and perhaps juvenile animals in general, cute.\"\" should definitly either expound on the alluded-to \"\"good reasons\"\", or at the least link to somewhere in wikipedia where these reasons are enumerated and explained.\\n\\n-B. McGrauw (not logged in)\\n\\nI think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article. What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question, but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article.\\n\\nIn any case, the \"\"Every time you masturbate...\"\" joke should be removed. It was popular among internet humorists for a while, but not really worthy of note outside of its own article; also, it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article.\\n\\nAny thoughts?\\n \\nHey.. i was looking for imformation on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came acrossed the discussion board.. i cant believe like a page was devoted to whether or not an article should linked on the page.. who really cares... i hope yas rnt losing sleep over it...(n)... i dunt mean to sound like a biotch... but its boring to read about all the complaints... and the point of the board is to write about cats/kittens.. atleast thats what the impression i got .. could b wrong though (anon)\\n\\nThe reference to the \"\"Every time you masturbate...\"\" joke should be removed. It does nothing to enhance the article. And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia, a parent has to answer questions about masturbation. It\\'s offensive, if nothing else.  \\n\\nIn response to the first anon, this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved. Some off-topic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive.\\nIn response to Wabazana, Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors. However, I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references. I\\'ve boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty (which was already in \\'see also\\'), which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader.  \\n\\nLovely though it is, is \"\"perceptions of cuteness\"\" really encyclopaedic?   \\nWell, it\\'s interesting. It\\'s written in a neutral point of view. And as regards verifiability, if \\'kittens are cute\\' isn\\'t common knowledge, then I don\\'t know what is. So yes, I for one think it\\'s encyclopaedic.  ( T | C | A ) \\n\\nI read about the \\'\"\"perceptions of cuteness\"\" discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal, Wed. August 15th edition, and was thrilled. The cuteness of kittens/cats is one of my favorite subjects, to the annoyance of everyone who knows me. I do agree with another poster\\'s comment that the pics of the kittens on this page aren\\'t necessarily the best. Feel free to use this picture of my kitten PJ.  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Pj_blinds.jpg\\nI believe when one sets his/her eyes on this image, there can be no question of the cuteness of kittens. Earnest t. bass is legendary and also a good example.  \"',\n",
